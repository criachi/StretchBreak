# StretchBreak

A Google Chrome extension that reminds you to take stretching breaks. 

Currently functions as a timer set to a default of 30 seconds simply for testing purposes. When it is time for a break, a new popup window is created to alert the user of a break time being scheduled. 

Necessary functionality to add: 
- Have a separate break timer, not just an alert that it is time for a break
- Ability to pause/stop either timer
