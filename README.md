# StretchBreak

A basic Google Chrome extension that reminds you to take stretching breaks. This project was for experimenting with HTML and CSS on a small scale (hence forgive the objectively bad UI and sense of design) and to use JavaScript in the context of Chrome extensions. 

When it is time for a break, a new popup window is created to alert the user of a break time being scheduled. 

Work timer can only be stopped completely, not paused. 

## Work Sprint Duration and StretchBreak duration are customizable
